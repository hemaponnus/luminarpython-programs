I am BHARATH CHANDRAN. M, Employee code â€“ IFBAPPL06306 working as CSR in Kerala Branch for last few years.
I am leaving my current job to attend my next assignment. I want to state that my last working day with IFB Appliances Ltd. will be 31/01/2021
It was nice and learning phase of my professional life. I thank all my seniors and colleagues for their guidance and supports.
Request you to process my full and final settlement, if any, at the earliest and issue an experience service letter for my future endeavour.
